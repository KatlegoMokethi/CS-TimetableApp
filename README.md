Final year project: Timetable App for all courses within the department of Computer Science &amp; Informatics

# About the application
Refer to the "PROJECT DOCUMENTATION" file

## Requirements
*	Be easy to use.
*	Usable on both mobile devices and desktops.
*	Allow a student to login to the App and present a personal timetable for all CS subjects for the week (from Mon-Sat).
*	Can be viewed per day or three days or the whole week. [*Always be available].
*	Display all assessments (assignments, tests and exam) due dates.
*	Set a reminder system to warn/inform students about upcoming assessments.
*	All info should be administered by the lecturer. (The information will be provided by the lecturer who administers the coursework with the exception of the examination dates and times, which will be provided via the examination department when it becomes available via an excel sheet that is published on the UFS website.)
*	Should access existing PeopleSoft marks system and display them to the student.
*	Data should be easily accessible for the student.
*	Compute current semester mark (for each course), calculate required mark per upcoming assessment to reach a goal mark (set by the student on the first day of a new semester).
*	Display the venue & lecturer for the class when a subject is clicked by the student.
*	Display contact details (phone and email) of the lecturer when clicking their name.
*	Open the required program when clicking any contact detail.

## Additional features added
*	Prediction of student’s results (pass/fail) based on the past performance and a trend of their current performance. Provide as a report to the lecturer in question and an icon on the student’s timetable.
*	Student dashboard: Should include overall performance for each course, display all assessments and a timeline of each past & upcoming assessment. (Be usable and interactive).

## Another feature
*	Online chat with lecturer. A space where the student will be able to communicate with his lecturer online at any given time. 
  *	Student can: send queries and questions whenever they have any. 
  *	The Lecturer will then receive a notification that he has received a message from a student.
  *	Message only read once online and give feedback to student or suggest other options with the student.
  
## Modified functionality
*	Machine learning: Just perform calculations based on student marks for completed assessments whether or not he will reach predicate (system defined goal).
*	Using small coloured icons (indicating exam promise):
*	Predicate not reached (0% to 39%)  red icon FAIL
*	Predicate = 40% to 50% yellow icon DANGER
*	Predicate = 51% to 59% blue icon SAFE ENOUGH
*	Predicate = 60% to 100% green icon COMPLETELY SAFE
